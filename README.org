#+TITLE: Ibrahim's Dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Ibrahim Muftee

Uses GNU Stow - https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

** Usage

#+begin_src shell
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/ibrahimmuftee/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles/
  cd .dotfiles 
#+end_src

Then, you type =stow= and whichever folder you want.

*NOTE:* Before using GNU Stow, make the directories of the config files you want (ex: =mkdir ~/.config/nvim= for neovim) or else all the other files that are not config files will end up in the stow directory.
